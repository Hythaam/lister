# Lister Usage

## Login
If a user is not logged in, they are directed to the `/login` page, where they can enter an email address and password.

For a user that is logged in, a "logout" button is located in the upper right corner of the screen. This button will immediately log the user out.

## Navigation
The left side of the screen includes a navigation pane.
This pane includes collapsable sections for lists and groups.
To add a new list or group, the user can select the "+" button next to the section title.

> Note: The API for lists and groups is not complete yet.
